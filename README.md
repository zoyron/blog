## Take responsibility

* Start with yourself, do something, can you get a job? 
* Have something to show for your miserable life.
* After you've sorted yourself, start taking responsibility for someone else - could be your parents, your partner, your child, then start working towards your immediate community, then the larger community. 

## Work on language

- Educate yourself.
* Study great men and women. Learn from their lives.
* Get rid of umms, like, uhss and pauses, and hindi equivalents from you speech. Be precise with your tongue.

+ Say the truth, remove everything else that you use to manipulate others by your speech.
	* Great people are brutally truthful to themselves and to others.
