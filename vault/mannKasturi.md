"Mann Kasturi re," a profog, encapsulates a beautiful metaphor within its lyrics. The song intertwines the essence of the soul ("mann") with the musk deer ("kasturi"), known for its fragrant scent.

In simple terms, the song likens the human soul to the musk deer, which spends its life searching for the source of its enchanting fragrance. Little does the deer know that the captivating scent originates from within itself. Similarly, the song suggests that we, like the musk deer, seek fulfillment and happiness outside ourselves, unaware that the key to contentment lies within us.

Moreover, "Mann Kasturi re" touches upon the allegory of the revered river Ganga, traversing ancient cities of India and touching lives across diverse languages and faiths. Rivers have held deep significance across civilizations, just like the Ganga, revered as the source of life, purifier of sins, and carrier of mortality. The song draws a parallel, hinting at the river's mystique and significance in our lives, juxtaposing it with our quest for meaning and enlightenment.

The poetry within "Mann Kasturi re" delves into the human experienceâ€”navigating life's various stages, from youth to maturity, seeking purpose, hope, and perspective shifts. It's a subtle introspection, resonating with the complexities of human existence and the quest for enlightenment.
