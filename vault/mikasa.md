# Mikasa - cruel or compassionate?

I tend to take Mikasa’s philosophy in a lot of situations. Yes, the world sucks, it’s merciless and cruel and yet it still is beautiful. There are still things I find worth fighting for and living for regardless of how messy things can get. 

I came into this world, imperfect and chaotic, yet I'm determined to find my way amidst its complexities. I'll stand by those who fill my life with purpose, for they are my world's true beauty. Loving them, nurturing passions, and embracing dreams ignites hope within me. They say hope lingers till the end, for when hope fades, life itself slips away.
In this imperfect world, I strive to craft moments of light, for in fighting for those I cherish, I discover the essence of a beautiful life.

Advocates of antinatalism will say that bringing kids into this world will bring them suffering, they will have experiences that might not be so great. But they will also experience amazing things, things that sometimes remind you why you are even alive. 

I guess it all comes down to what are terrible thing you’ll experience. This will probably end up depending who your parents are and your background. Which is why I sometimes believe you should be evaluated on whether you are capable of having a kid but that’s another story.
