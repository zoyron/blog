# Mr. Voyager

Voyager 1, the farthest man-made object fro earth. It is over 22 billion kilometers from Earth. Sometimes I like to do a thought experiment where I imagine an immortal astronaut inside Voyager 1 and then I wonder about all the things that must be going inside his head.  

How does he feel being so alone? What does he think? What does he do about all the thoughts? I keep wondering about such things. 

* I mean, I am so envious of Mr. Voyager. Floating around in deep space, 0 distractions, all the time to himself. I enjoy thinking that I am in place of Mr. Voyager, I really wish I could switch my place with Voyager 1. After a few 100 or 1000 kms he will stop working completely, then he will have all the time in the universe to float and think about anything he wants. But is that really what I want?

My floating around time now is disturbed by the things like family, job, girlfriend, friends. I have everything a person wants in life, yet, I yearn for what voyager 1 has.
