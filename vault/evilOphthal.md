You can start by telling your patients that their vision will be restored to normal and they can see fine after surgery.

Start building up their hope.  Even tell them that you will charge one-third of the price. Make them very happy with sweet talking, and feed it in their heads that they will be the happiest after getting the surgery done.

And on the day of operation do nothing. Let them think that they are being operated on, but in reality, nothing is happening. Then take a third of the price for now. The patients will leave very happy.

Now, prescribe them an eye drop that makes vision very blurry for a long time. The drop they used to put in eyes every time one visited Vasan eye care, but stronger than that. Tell them to put that drop in the eye 5 times a day so that their vision for 12 days remains blurry.

Be specific about 12 days. Don't give them a range like 10-12 days or 10-15 days. Patients feel good if they are told to follow a routine for a specific number of days. This way they trust and even like the doctor more.

Mention to them that their vision will be blurry for 12 days because of the "surgery", lol. They will never find out it is the eye drops. Then tell them that there is a 99% chance that their vision will be restored and only a 1 percent chance for a fuck up.  No one thinks that the 1% would happen to them. Everyone sees themselves as the happy 99% side. 

Tell them to call you after 12 days if the vision is still blurry. When they call and report the blurry vision, tell them to increase the dose from 5 times a day to 8 times a day for the next week. And if still blurry, call me again.

Now the evil part, while telling them to increase the dose for the next week you have to sound a bit worried and uncomfortable giving them a slight hint that the sad 1% thing may or may not happen to them
Because the confirmation of something bad brings a kind of relief. But the confusion whether it might or might not happen brings along anxiety, tension, and overthinking. 
Your patients should live through this suspense for a week. This will torment them, they will curse their fate for the whole week. 

Now, after a week as well their vision will remain blurry, lol. They will call you again. This time you have to prescribe them the same eye drop but from a different company so they don't suspect anything. Telling them to use for 10 more days 6 times a day, because it is stronger xD

Give them a little hope that this new medicine may or may not improve their condition. Keep them in the circle. Don't give them the confirmation of good, but don't give them the confirmation of the bad either. Keep them in the middle, in the unknown, that is where people suffer the most.

After these people have suffered for 10 more days with the new eye drop, they will reach out to you again. Don't pick up the call that day. Let them suffer another day.

Then pick up their call the next day and tell them that they have to get a surgery ASAP or the patient will lose their eyesight permanently. 

This time charge them the full telling them that this is a bigger surgery. This time, do the procedure they came to you for the very first time, and prescribe them the medication you have done the first time. 

Do everything that you should have done the first time but tell them this is the bigger surgery. 
So in a few days, the patient's vision will become normal, you will have earned the full fee + one-third extra, and enjoyed the misery of patients for around a month
