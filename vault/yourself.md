# Be yourself?

“Be Yourself” are the two dumbest words, ever. It’s like saying “water is H2O”, right? Okay, maybe you don’t mean it so tautologically. Perhaps you mean, “find yourself”. Where is this box of self-figurines which I shall find my self in? When would I know it is mine, will it call my name out loud when I touch it?

I have these questions, but don’t treat me as a kid. Hear me out.

You tell me that I will simply know when it’s mine. When I hold that figurine, and wear its skin, I shall feel my most comfortable under it. Most uninhibitedly unencumbered. Most free, to be me. You tell me that it won’t be easy to get to that freedom, but that I will get there, through a rebellion. A path of difficulties, drudgeries. Then answer me this, what kind of freedom do you talk of, if I must shackle myself in certain drudgery to reach it?

I will never reach my self, because never shall I be free. Human existence begs for nothing but getting-used-to. To misery, to happiness, to war, to poverty, to love. So stop looking for freedom in the confines of that box of self-figurines. Let go of that box on the floor, let it crash with the harshest possible noise, and set fire to it. Set fire to every mould that tries to touch and encapsulate you.

I will never reach my self, because there is nowhere to reach. You may never truly be free, but don’t let that stop you from elevating your idea of freedom. Being yourself can now truly stand, for what it literally means.

Be. Just, be.

And in your pursuit of existence, whichever path you pick, of drudgery, pleasure, violence or love. Realise that you were free to pick any of those infinite paths, but you picked some. You picked one. Appreciate that you can be everything at once, but time binds you to be one thing, at a time. That your existence is nothing but an inseparable relationship with time itself, which stops you from being everything all at once. Come, let us rage this rebellion against time.

I know you have doubts, worries and queries. Those which cannot be answered. But they demand examination, nevertheless.

You have these questions, but please treat yourself as a kid. Hear him or her out. And perhaps don’t just hear this time, listen.
